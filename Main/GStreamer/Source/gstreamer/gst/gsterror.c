/**
 * SECTION:gsterror
 * @short_description: Categorized error messages
 * @see_also: #GstMessage
 *
 * GStreamer elements can throw non-fatal warnings and fatal errors.
 * Higher-level elements and applications can programatically filter
 * the ones they are interested in or can recover from,
 * and have a default handler handle the rest of them.
 *
 * The rest of this section will use the term <quote>error</quote>
 * to mean both (non-fatal) warnings and (fatal) errors; they are treated
 * similarly.
 *
 * Errors from elements are the combination of a #GError and a debug string.
 * The #GError contains:
 * - a domain type: CORE, LIBRARY, RESOURCE or STREAM
 * - a code: an enum value specific to the domain
 * - a translated, human-readable message
 * - a non-translated additional debug string, which also contains
 * - file and line information
 *
 * Elements do not have the context required to decide what to do with
 * errors.  As such, they should only inform about errors, and stop their
 * processing.  In short, an element doesn't know what it is being used for.
 *
 * It is the application or compound element using the given element that
 * has more context about the use of the element. Errors can be received by
 * listening to the #GstBus of the element/pipeline for #GstMessage objects with
 * the type %GST_MESSAGE_ERROR or %GST_MESSAGE_WARNING. The thrown errors should
 * be inspected, and filtered if appropriate.
 *
 * An application is expected to, by default, present the user with a
 * dialog box (or an equivalent) showing the error message.  The dialog
 * should also allow a way to get at the additional debug information,
 * so the user can provide bug reporting information.
 *
 * A compound element is expected to forward errors by default higher up
 * the hierarchy; this is done by default in the same way as for other types
 * of #GstMessage.
 *
 * When applications or compound elements trigger errors that they can
 * recover from, they can filter out these errors and take appropriate action.
 * For example, an application that gets an error from xvimagesink
 * that indicates all XVideo ports are taken, the application can attempt
 * to use another sink instead.
 *
 * Elements throw errors using the #GST_ELEMENT_ERROR convenience macro:
 *
 * <example>
 * <title>Throwing an error</title>
 *   <programlisting>
 *     GST_ELEMENT_ERROR (src, RESOURCE, NOT_FOUND,
 *       (_("No file name specified for reading.")), (NULL));
 *   </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * Things to keep in mind:
 * <itemizedlist>
 *   <listitem><para>Don't go off inventing new error codes.  The ones
 *     currently provided should be enough.  If you find your type of error
 *     does not fit the current codes, you should use FAILED.</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>Don't provide a message if the default one suffices.
 *     this keeps messages more uniform.  Use (NULL) - not forgetting the
 *     parentheses.</para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>If you do supply a custom message, it should be
 *     marked for translation.  The message should start with a capital
 *     and end with a period.  The message should describe the error in short,
 *     in a human-readable form, and without any complex technical terms.
 *     A user interface will present this message as the first thing a user
 *     sees.  Details, technical info, ... should go in the debug string.
 *   </para></listitem>
 *   <listitem><para>The debug string can be as you like.  Again, use (NULL)
 *     if there's nothing to add - file and line number will still be
 *     passed.  #GST_ERROR_SYSTEM can be used as a shortcut to give
 *     debug information on a system call error.</para></listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
