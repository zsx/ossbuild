 * @adapter: adapter to hold the chunk
 * NOTE: To have a explanation of each parameters of this function look at the

 *
 * This function holds a chunk into the adapter. If there is enough bytes
 * (*@read > *@bufsize), then it just hold and make the parser continue after
 * the chunk by setting @next_start properly. Otherwise, if there is not
 * enough bytes in @buf, it just set @next_start and @next_size, to make the
 * parse return META_PARSING_NEED_MORE_DATA and request the caller the proper
 * offset and size, so in the sencond time this function is called it should
 * (or must) have enough data hold the whole chunk.
 *
 * Returns:
 * <itemizedlist>
 * <listitem><para>%META_PARSING_ERROR
 * </para></listitem>
 * <listitem><para>%META_PARSING_DONE if the chunk bas been completely hold
 * </para></listitem>
