Compiling AMRWB encoder:
========================

To compile the amrwb encoder, you need to download the source code from 
"http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/26204.htm" and uncompress the 
files inside an amrwb-code directory;

or execute this commands:
$cd amrwb-code
$sh ./run.sh

and run the "autogen" script again.
