Compiling AMRWB codec:
======================

To compile the amrwb codec, you need to download the source code from 
"http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/26204.htm" and uncompress the 
files inside an amrwb-code directory;

or execute this commands:
$cd amrwb-code
$sh ./run.sh

and run the "autogen" script again.
