GStreamer uses a *large* array of tools and libraries, most of which are
optional.  We have attempted to make sure that any code that depends on
optional libraries doesn't get built unless you have those libraries.  If
you find this not to be the case, please, let us know by filing a bug
report at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/.


Required tools:
===============

An extra set of tools is required if you wish to build GStreamer out of
CVS (using autogen.sh):

autoconf 2.52 or better
automake 1.5
gettext 0.11.5
libtool v1.4 or better
pkgconfig 0.9.0 or better (http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/)

Required libraries:
===================

The core GStreamer libraries. See the gstreamer/ module in GStreamer cvs, or
the version that corresponds to this plugin release.

Package:	GStreamer
Version:	0.10.0
Recommended:	0.10.latest
URL:		http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/
DebianPackage:	libgstreamer0.10-dev
Notes:		The required version is updated frequently, so the version
	listed in this file is often wrong.  If you are compiling from CVS,
	the required version is often the latest GStreamer CVS.

Package:	liboil
Version:	>= 0.3.8
Recommended:	0.3.latest
URL:		http://liboil.freedesktop.org/
DebianPackage:	liboil0.3-dev

Package:	glew
Version:	>= 1.4.0
Recommended:	1.5.latest
URL:		http://glew.sourceforge.net/
DebianPackage:	libglew1.5-dev


Optional libraries:
===================

This file lists supporting libraries for which gst-plugins-gl contains
plugins, as well as their minimum version.  You can find the corresponding
plugins in ext/(library)
