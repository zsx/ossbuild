gstreamer-sharp are the C#/CLI bindings for GStreamer.

It's currently at a early state of development and the API
might still change slightly in incompatible ways until
the first stable release 0.10.0.

There are bindings for the complete GStreamer core and some
of the GStreamer libraries.

For building the bindings you need:
  * Mono 2.4 or MS .NET 2.0 or higher
  * GLib >= 2.18
  * GStreamer and gst-plugins-base >= 0.10.24
  * Optionally GTK# >= 2.12 and Mono.Cairo for the samples
  * Optionally nunit >= 2.4 for the unit tests

Note that the Gst.GLib namespace contains complete GLib bindings
but only for convinience reasons. Once a new glib-sharp was released
with everything that is needed for gstreamer-sharp this namespace
will be removed and a dependency on glib-sharp will be added.
