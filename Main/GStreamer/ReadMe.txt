
Download.bat 	Utility for downloading the source from the gstreamer archives 
		and extracting it under the source/ directory.


Generate.bat 	Utility for calling the various flex, bison, and glib 
		(perl-based) scripts and creating auto-generated source for 
		some areas of the code such as the command line parser, 
		object metadata, etc. 

		You shouldn't have any need to run this except when you 
		have updated the source to a new version.


GStreamer.ico 	Icon embedded in executables created by OSSBuild. It just 
		adds some pizzazz, nothing more.
