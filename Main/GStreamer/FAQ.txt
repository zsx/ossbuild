
Q: Does gstreamer provide a way for me to iterate over possible media outputs 
   (e.g., a list of sound cards, possible video sinks, etc.)?

A: The API to find appropriate elements is ok. The API to then find e.g. particular 
   sound cards is sucky, but usable if you must. Look at the gstregistry API for 
   how to find elements. Look at GstPropertyProbe to figure out what you can set for 
   the particular device, etc (but that API is hairy).
