TODO list for LibMMS
--------------------

* mms.c:

   - remove dependency on xine_stream_t

   - resolve asfheader.h status
      Ask xine maintainers if it's OK to just copy it (done, but no
   reply yet)

   - get rid of xine_internal.h inclusion
      There are lots of Xine internal vars and defines used, get rid
   of them, and delete #include "xine_internal.h"

   - better log handling
      Allow installing custom log handlers a'la GLib. Currently it is
   done by #ifdef LOG printf(...), which is rather suboptimal and not
   suitable for library

   - custom I/O functions provide sane default implementations
      Allow installing custom I/O functions. Xine needs this to
   provide cancellable I/O, as does probably anyone aiming to provide
   usable app

   - sort out iconv() usage
      I don't like the way it's currently used, especially I think
   that source charset isn't obtained correctly

* i18n:

   - gettextize
      Gettextize source, currently there is some gettext used,
   determine how much is done and what else needs to be gettextized
