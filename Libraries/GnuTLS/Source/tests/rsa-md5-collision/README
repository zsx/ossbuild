This directory contains colliding X.509 certificates for different
identities, from:

http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/TargetCollidingCertificates/

The certificates are used by a simple self-test script,
rsa-md5-collision, that check to make sure that GnuTLS reject both
certificate chains.

The file mbox contain mail exchanges with the authors where they agree
to release the certificates under a permissive license, that allow the
files to be included here.
