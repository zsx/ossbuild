.SH NAME
gnutls_crypto_bigint_register2 \- register a bigint interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_crypto_bigint_register2(int " priority ", int " version ", gnutls_crypto_bigint_st * " s ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "int priority" 12
is the priority of the interface
.IP "int version" 12
should be set to \fBGNUTLS_CRYPTO_API_VERSION\fP
.IP "gnutls_crypto_bigint_st * s" 12
is a structure holding new interface's data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will register an interface for gnutls to operate
on big integers. Any interface registered will override
the included interface. The interface with the lowest
priority will be used by gnutls.

Note that the bigint interface must interoperate with the public
key interface. Thus if this interface is updated the
\fBgnutls_crypto_pk_register()\fP should also be used.

This function should be called before \fBgnutls_global_init()\fP.

For simplicity you can use the convenience \fBgnutls_crypto_bigint_register()\fP
macro.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise an error.
.SH "SINCE"
2.6.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
