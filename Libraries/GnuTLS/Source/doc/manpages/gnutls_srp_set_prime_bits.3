.SH NAME
gnutls_srp_set_prime_bits \- set the minimum bits for a SRP ciphersuite
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_srp_set_prime_bits(gnutls_session_t " session ", unsigned int " bits ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "unsigned int bits" 12
is the number of bits
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets the minimum accepted number of bits, for use in
an SRP key exchange.  If zero, the default 2048 bits will be used.

In the client side it sets the minimum accepted number of bits.  If
a server sends a prime with less bits than that
\fBGNUTLS_E_RECEIVED_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER\fP will be returned by the
handshake.
