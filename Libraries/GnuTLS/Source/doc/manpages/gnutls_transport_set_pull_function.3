.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the function where you set a function for gnutls 
to receive data. Normally, if you use berkeley style sockets,
do not need to use this function since the default (recv(2)) will 
probably be ok.

PULL_FUNC is of the form, 
ssize_t (*gnutls_pull_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, void*, size_t);
