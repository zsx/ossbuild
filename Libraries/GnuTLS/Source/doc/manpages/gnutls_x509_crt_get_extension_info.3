.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_info \- Get extension id and criticality
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_info(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", int " indx ", void * " oid ", size_t * " sizeof_oid ", int * " critical ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP structure
.IP "int indx" 12
Specifies which extension OID to send. Use zero to get the first one.
.IP "void * oid" 12
a pointer to a structure to hold the OID
.IP "size_t * sizeof_oid" 12
initially holds the maximum size of \fIoid\fP, on return
holds actual size of \fIoid\fP.
.IP "int * critical" 12
output variable with critical flag, may be NULL.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the requested extension OID in the
certificate, and the critical flag for it.  The extension OID will
be stored as a string in the provided buffer.  Use
\fBgnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_data()\fP to extract the data.

If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
*\fIsizeof_oid\fP is updated and \fBGNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER\fP will be
returned.

Return 0 on success.  A negative value may be returned in case of
parsing error.  If you have reached the last extension available
GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.
