.SH NAME
gnutls_ia_allocate_server_credentials \- Used to allocate an gnutls_ia_server_credentials_t structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/extra.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_ia_allocate_server_credentials(gnutls_ia_server_credentials_t * " sc ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_ia_server_credentials_t * sc" 12
is a pointer to an \fBgnutls_ia_server_credentials_t\fP structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This structure is complex enough to manipulate directly thus this
helper function is provided in order to allocate it.

Adding this credential to a session will enable TLS/IA, and will
require an Application Phase after the TLS handshake (if the client
support TLS/IA).  Use \fBgnutls_ia_require_inner_phase()\fP to toggle the
TLS/IA mode.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise
an error code is returned.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gnutls@gnu.org>.
