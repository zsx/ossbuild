.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_file \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_file(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t " res ", const char * " pkcs12file ", gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t " type ", const char * " password ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_certificate_credentials_t res" 12
is an \fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP structure.
.IP "const char * pkcs12file" 12
filename of file containing PKCS\fB12\fP blob.
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type" 12
is PEM or DER of the \fIpkcs12file\fP.
.IP "const char * password" 12
optional password used to decrypt PKCS\fB12\fP file, bags and keys.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets a certificate/private key pair and/or a CRL in
the gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.  This function may
be called more than once (in case multiple keys/certificates exist
for the server).
.SH "MAC"
ed PKCS\fB12\fP files are supported.  Encrypted PKCS\fB12\fP bags are
supported.  Encrypted PKCS\fB8\fP private keys are supported.  However,
only password based security, and the same password for all
operations, are supported.

The private keys may be RSA PKCS\fB1\fP or DSA private keys encoded in
the OpenSSL way.

PKCS\fB12\fP file may contain many keys and/or certificates, and there
is no way to identify which key/certificate pair you want.  You
should make sure the PKCS\fB12\fP file only contain one key/certificate
pair and/or one CRL.

It is believed that the limitations of this function is acceptable
for most usage, and that any more flexibility would introduce
complexity that would make it harder to use this functionality at
all.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or an error code.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gnutls@gnu.org>.
