.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crq_get_pk_algorithm \- This function returns the certificate request's PublicKey algorithm
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crq_get_pk_algorithm(gnutls_x509_crq_t " crq ", unsigned int * " bits ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crq_t crq" 12
should contain a gnutls_x509_crq_t structure
.IP "unsigned int * bits" 12
if bits is non null it will hold the size of the parameters' in bits
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the public key algorithm of a PKCS \\fB10\fP 
certificate request.

If bits is non null, it should have enough size to hold the parameters
size in bits. For RSA the bits returned is the modulus. 
For DSA the bits returned are of the public
exponent.
.SH "RETURNS"
a member of the \fBgnutls_pk_algorithm_t\fP enumeration on
success, or a negative value on error.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gnutls@gnu.org>.
