.SH NAME
gnutls_record_get_direction \- return the direction of the last interrupted function call
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_record_get_direction(gnutls_session_t " session ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function provides information about the internals of the
record protocol and is only useful if a prior gnutls function call
(e.g.  \fBgnutls_handshake()\fP) was interrupted for some reason, that
is, if a function returned \fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP or
\fBGNUTLS_E_AGAIN\fP.  In such a case, you might want to call \fBselect()\fP
or \fBpoll()\fP before calling the interrupted gnutls function again.  To
tell you whether a file descriptor should be selected for either
reading or writing, \fBgnutls_record_get_direction()\fP returns 0 if the
interrupted function was trying to read data, and 1 if it was
trying to write data.
.SH "RETURNS"
0 if trying to read data, 1 if trying to write data.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
