.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_data \- Get the specified extension data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_data(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", int " indx ", void * " data ", size_t * " sizeof_data ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP structure
.IP "int indx" 12
Specifies which extension OID to send. Use zero to get the first one.
.IP "void * data" 12
a pointer to a structure to hold the data (may be null)
.IP "size_t * sizeof_data" 12
initially holds the size of \fIoid\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the requested extension data in the
certificate.  The extension data will be stored as a string in the
provided buffer.

Use \fBgnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_info()\fP to extract the OID and
critical flag.  Use \fBgnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_by_oid()\fP instead,
if you want to get data indexed by the extension OID rather than
sequence.

Return 0 on success.  A negative value may be returned in case of
parsing error.  If you have reached the last extension available
GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.
