.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_privkey_export_pkcs8 \- This function will export the private key to PKCS8 format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_privkey_export_pkcs8(gnutls_x509_privkey_t " key ", gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t " format ", const char * " password ", unsigned int " flags ", void * " output_data ", size_t * " output_data_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_privkey_t key" 12
Holds the key
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t format" 12
the format of output params. One of PEM or DER.
.IP "const char * password" 12
the password that will be used to encrypt the key. 
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
an ORed sequence of gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t
.IP "void * output_data" 12
will contain a private key PEM or DER encoded
.IP "size_t * output_data_size" 12
holds the size of output_data (and will be
replaced by the actual size of parameters)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will export the private key to a PKCS8 structure.
Both RSA and DSA keys can be exported. For DSA keys we use
PKCS \fB11\fP definitions. If the flags do not specify the encryption 
cipher, then the default 3DES (PBES2) will be used.

The \fIpassword\fP can be either ASCII or UTF\-8 in the default PBES2
encryption schemas, or ASCII for the PKCS12 schemas.

If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
*output_data_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will
be returned.

If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header
of "BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY" or "BEGIN PRIVATE KEY" if
encryption is not used.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
In case of failure a negative value will be
returned, and 0 on success.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
