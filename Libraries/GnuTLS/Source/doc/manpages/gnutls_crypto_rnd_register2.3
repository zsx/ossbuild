.SH NAME
gnutls_crypto_rnd_register2 \- register a random generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_crypto_rnd_register2(int " priority ", int " version ", gnutls_crypto_rnd_st * " s ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "int priority" 12
is the priority of the generator
.IP "int version" 12
should be set to \fBGNUTLS_CRYPTO_API_VERSION\fP
.IP "gnutls_crypto_rnd_st * s" 12
is a structure holding new generator's data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will register a random generator to be used by
gnutls.  Any generator registered will override the included
generator and by convention kernel implemented generators have
priority of 90.  The generator with the lowest priority will be
used by gnutls.

This function should be called before \fBgnutls_global_init()\fP.

For simplicity you can use the convenience
\fBgnutls_crypto_rnd_register()\fP macro.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise an error.
.SH "SINCE"
