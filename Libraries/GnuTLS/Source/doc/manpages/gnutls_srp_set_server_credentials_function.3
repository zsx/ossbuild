.SH NAME
gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function \- Used to set a callback to retrieve the user's SRP credentials
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function(gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t          " cred ", gnutls_srp_server_credentials_function          * " func ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t          cred" 12
is a \fBgnutls_srp_server_credentials_t\fP structure.
.IP "gnutls_srp_server_credentials_function          * func" 12
is the callback function
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the user's SRP credentials.
The callback's function form is:
int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const char* username,
gnutls_datum_t* salt, gnutls_datum_t *verifier, gnutls_datum_t* g,
gnutls_datum_t* n);

\fIusername\fP contains the actual username. 
The \fIsalt\fP, \fIverifier\fP, \fIgenerator\fP and \fIprime\fP must be filled
in using the \fBgnutls_malloc()\fP. For convenience \fIprime\fP and \fIgenerator\fP 
may also be one of the static parameters defined in extra.h.

In case the callback returned a negative number then gnutls will
assume that the username does not exist.

In order to prevent attackers from guessing valid usernames,
if a user does not exist, g and n values should be filled in
using a random user's parameters. In that case the callback must
return the special value (1).

The callback function will only be called once per handshake.
The callback function should return 0 on success, while
\-1 indicates an error.
