.SH NAME
gnutls_credentials_set \- Sets the needed credentials for the specified authentication algorithm.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_credentials_set(gnutls_session_t " session ", gnutls_credentials_type_t " type ", void * " cred ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "gnutls_credentials_type_t type" 12
is the type of the credentials
.IP "void * cred" 12
is a pointer to a structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets the needed credentials for the specified type.
Eg username, password \- or public and private keys etc.  
The (void* cred) parameter is a structure that depends on the
specified type and on the current session (client or server).
[ In order to minimize memory usage, and share credentials between 
several threads gnutls keeps a pointer to cred, and not the whole cred
structure. Thus you will have to keep the structure allocated until   
you call \fBgnutls_deinit()\fP. ]

For GNUTLS_CRD_ANON cred should be gnutls_anon_client_credentials_t in case of a client.
In case of a server it should be gnutls_anon_server_credentials_t.

For GNUTLS_CRD_SRP cred should be gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t
in case of a client, and gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t, in case
of a server.

For GNUTLS_CRD_CERTIFICATE cred should be gnutls_certificate_credentials_t.
