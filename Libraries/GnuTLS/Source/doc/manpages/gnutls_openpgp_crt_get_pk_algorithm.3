.SH NAME
gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_pk_algorithm \- return the key's PublicKey algorithm
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/openpgp.h>
.sp
.BI "gnutls_pk_algorithm_t gnutls_openpgp_crt_get_pk_algorithm(gnutls_openpgp_crt_t " key ", unsigned int * " bits ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_openpgp_crt_t key" 12
is an OpenPGP key
.IP "unsigned int * bits" 12
if bits is non null it will hold the size of the parameters' in bits
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the public key algorithm of an OpenPGP
certificate.

If bits is non null, it should have enough size to hold the parameters
size in bits. For RSA the bits returned is the modulus.
For DSA the bits returned are of the public exponent.
.SH "RETURNS"
a member of the \fBgnutls_pk_algorithm_t\fP enumeration on
success, or a negative value on error.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gnutls@gnu.org>.
