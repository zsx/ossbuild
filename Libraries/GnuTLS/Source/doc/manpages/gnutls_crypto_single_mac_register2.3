.SH NAME
gnutls_crypto_single_mac_register2 \- register a MAC algorithm
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_crypto_single_mac_register2(gnutls_mac_algorithm_t " algorithm ", int " priority ", int " version ", gnutls_crypto_single_mac_st * " s ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_mac_algorithm_t algorithm" 12
is the gnutls algorithm identifier
.IP "int priority" 12
is the priority of the algorithm
.IP "int version" 12
should be set to \fBGNUTLS_CRYPTO_API_VERSION\fP
.IP "gnutls_crypto_single_mac_st * s" 12
is a structure holding new algorithms's data
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will register a MAC algorithm to be used by gnutls.
Any algorithm registered will override the included algorithms and
by convention kernel implemented algorithms have priority of 90.
The algorithm with the lowest priority will be used by gnutls.

This function should be called before \fBgnutls_global_init()\fP.

For simplicity you can use the convenience
\fBgnutls_crypto_single_mac_register()\fP macro.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, otherwise an error.
.SH "SINCE"
2.6.0
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gnutls@gnu.org>.
