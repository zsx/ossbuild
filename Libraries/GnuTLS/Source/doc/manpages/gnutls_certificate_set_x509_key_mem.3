.SH NAME
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem \- Used to set keys in a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem(gnutls_certificate_credentials_t          " res ", const gnutls_datum_t * " cert ", const gnutls_datum_t * " key ", gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t " type ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_certificate_credentials_t          res" 12
is an \fBgnutls_certificate_credentials_t\fP structure.
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * cert" 12
contains a certificate list (path) for the specified private key
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * key" 12
is the private key, or \fBNULL\fP
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t type" 12
is PEM or DER
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the 
gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure. This function may be called
more than once (in case multiple keys/certificates exist for the
server).
.SH "CURRENTLY ARE SUPPORTED"
RSA PKCS\-1 encoded private keys, 
DSA private keys.

DSA private keys are encoded the OpenSSL way, which is an ASN.1
DER sequence of 6 INTEGERs \- version, p, q, g, pub, priv.

Note that the keyUsage (2.5.29.15) PKIX extension in X.509 certificates 
is supported. This means that certificates intended for signing cannot
be used for ciphersuites that require encryption.

If the certificate and the private key are given in PEM encoding
then the strings that hold their values must be null terminated.

The \fIkey\fP may be \fBNULL\fP if you are using a sign callback, see
\fBgnutls_sign_callback_set()\fP.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or an error code.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
