.SH NAME
gnutls_mac_list \- Get a list of supported MAC algorithms
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "const gnutls_mac_algorithm_t * gnutls_mac_list( " void ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP " void" 12
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Get a list of hash algorithms for use as MACs.  Note that not
necessarily all MACs are supported in TLS cipher suites.  For
example, MD2 is not supported as a cipher suite, but is supported
for other purposes (e.g., X.509 signature verification or similar).
.SH "RETURNS"
Return a zero\-terminated list of \fBgnutls_mac_algorithm_t\fP
integers indicating the available MACs.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-gnutls@gnu.org>.
