.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name2 \- Get certificate's alternative name, if any
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name2(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", unsigned int " seq ", void * " ret ", size_t * " ret_size ", unsigned int * " ret_type ", unsigned int * " critical ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP structure
.IP "unsigned int seq" 12
specifies the sequence number of the alt name (0 for the first one, 1 for the second etc.)
.IP "void * ret" 12
is the place where the alternative name will be copied to
.IP "size_t * ret_size" 12
holds the size of ret.
.IP "unsigned int * ret_type" 12
holds the type of the alternative name (one of gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t).
.IP "unsigned int * critical" 12
will be non zero if the extension is marked as critical (may be null)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return the alternative names, contained in the
given certificate. It is the same as \fBgnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name()\fP
except for the fact that it will return the type of the alternative
name in \fIret_type\fP even if the function fails for some reason (i.e.
the buffer provided is not enough).

The return values are the same as with \fBgnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name()\fP.
