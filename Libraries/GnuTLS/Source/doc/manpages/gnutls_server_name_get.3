.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will allow you to get the name indication (if any),
a client has sent. The name indication may be any of the enumeration
gnutls_server_name_type_t.

If \fItype\fP is GNUTLS_NAME_DNS, then this function is to be used by servers
that support virtual hosting, and the data will be a null terminated UTF\-8 string.

If \fIdata\fP has not enough size to hold the server name GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER
is returned, and \fIdata_length\fP will hold the required size.

\fIindex\fP is used to retrieve more than one server names (if sent by the client).
The first server name has an index of 0, the second 1 and so on. If no name with the given
index exists GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.
