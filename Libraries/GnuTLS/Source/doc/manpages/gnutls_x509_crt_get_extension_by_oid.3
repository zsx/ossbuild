.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t " cert ", const char * " oid ", int " indx ", void * " buf ", size_t * " sizeof_buf ", unsigned int * " critical ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t cert" 12
should contain a \fBgnutls_x509_crt_t\fP structure
.IP "const char * oid" 12

In case multiple same OIDs exist in the extensions, this specifies which to send. Use zero to get the first one.
.IP "void * buf" 12
a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be null)
.IP "size_t * sizeof_buf" 12
initially holds the size of \fIbuf\fP
.IP "unsigned int * critical" 12
will be non zero if the extension is marked as critical
