.BI "int gnutls_x509_rdn_get_by_oid(const gnutls_datum_t * " idn ", const char * " oid ", int " indx ", unsigned int " raw_flag ", void * " buf ", size_t * " sizeof_buf ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * idn" 12
should contain a DER encoded RDN sequence
.IP "const char * oid" 12
an Object Identifier

If non zero then the raw DER data are returned.
.IP "void * buf" 12
a pointer to a structure to hold the peer's name
.IP "size_t * sizeof_buf" 12
