This function is to be used by clients that want to inform 
(via a TLS extension mechanism) the server of the name they
connected to. This should be used by clients that connect
to servers that do virtual hosting.

The value of \fIname\fP depends on the \fIind\fP type. In case of GNUTLS_NAME_DNS,
an ASCII or UTF\-8 null terminated string, without the trailing dot, is expected. 
IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are not permitted.
