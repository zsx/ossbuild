.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crq_get_dn_by_oid \- This function returns the Certificate request subject's distinguished name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crq_get_dn_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crq_t " crq ", const char * " oid ", int " indx ", unsigned int " raw_flag ", void * " buf ", size_t * " sizeof_buf ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crq_t crq" 12
should contain a gnutls_x509_crq_t structure
.IP "const char * oid" 12
holds an Object Identified in null terminated string
.IP "int indx" 12
In case multiple same OIDs exist in the RDN, this specifies
which to send. Use zero to get the first one.
.IP "unsigned int raw_flag" 12
If non zero returns the raw DER data of the DN part.
.IP "void * buf" 12
a pointer to a structure to hold the name (may be null)
.IP "size_t * sizeof_buf" 12
initially holds the size of \fIbuf\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will extract the part of the name of the Certificate
request subject, specified by the given OID. The output will be
encoded as described in RFC2253. The output string will be ASCII
or UTF\-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.

Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h
If raw flag is zero, this function will only return known OIDs as
text. Other OIDs will be DER encoded, as described in RFC2253 \-\-
in hex format with a '\#' prefix.  You can check about known OIDs
using \fBgnutls_x509_dn_oid_known()\fP.

If \fIbuf\fP is null then only the size will be filled.
.SH "RETURNS"
GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER if the provided buffer is not
long enough, and in that case the *sizeof_buf will be updated with
the required size.  On success 0 is returned.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
