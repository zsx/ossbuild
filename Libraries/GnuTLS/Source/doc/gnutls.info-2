     If an otherName OID is known, the data will be decoded.  Otherwise
     the returned data will be DER encoded, and you will have to decode
     it yourself.  Currently, only the RFC 3920 id-on-xmppAddr SAN is
     recognized.

     `GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME'.

     *Returns:* the alternative subject name type on success, one of the
     enumerated gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t.  For supported OIDs, it
     will return one of the virtual (GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_*) types,
     e.g. `GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP', and `GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME' for
     unknown OIDs.  It will return `GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if
     `ret_size' is not large enough to hold the value.  In that case
     `ret_size' will be updated with the required size.  If the
     certificate does not have an Alternative name with the specified
     sequence number and with the otherName type then
     `GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE' is returned.

     the DN in turn points into the original certificate structure, and
     thus you may not deallocate the certificate and continue to access
     `dn'.

     *Returns:* Returns 0 on success, or an error code.

gnutls_x509_dn_import
---------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_dn_import (gnutls_x509_dn_t ODN, const
          gnutls_datum_t * DATA)
     ODN: the structure that will hold the imported DN

     DATA: should contain a DER encoded RDN sequence

     This function parses an RDN sequence and stores the result to a
     `gnutls_x509_dn_t' structure. The structure must have been
     initialized with `gnutls_x509_dn_init()'. You may use
     `gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava()' to decode the DN.  This function
     parses an RDN sequence and stores the result to a
     `gnutls_x509_dn_t' structure. The structure must have been
     initialized with `gnutls_x509_dn_init()'. You may use
     `gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava()' to decode the DN.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' is returned, otherwise a
     negative error value.

     *Since:* 2.4.0

     functions like `gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn_by_oid()' use the
     information on known OIDs to properly encode their input. Object
     Identifiers that are not known are not encoded by these functions,
     and their input is stored directly into the ASN.1 structure. In
     that case of unknown OIDs, you have the responsibility of DER
     encoding your data.

     OUTPUT_DATA: will contain a private key PEM or DER encoded

     OUTPUT_DATA_SIZE: holds the size of output_data (and will be
     replaced by the actual size of parameters)

     This function will export the private key to a PKCS8 structure.
     Both RSA and DSA keys can be exported. For DSA keys we use PKCS
     `11' definitions. If the flags do not specify the encryption
     cipher, then the default 3DES (PBES2) will be used.

     The `password' can be either ASCII or UTF-8 in the default PBES2
     encryption schemas, or ASCII for the PKCS12 schemas.

     If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then

9.5 TLS Inner Application (TLS/IA) Functions
============================================

The following functions are used for TLS Inner Application (TLS/IA).
Their prototypes lie in `gnutls/extra.h'.  You need to link with
`libgnutls-extra' to be able to use these functions (*note GnuTLS-extra
functions::).

The typical control flow in an TLS/IA client (that would not require an
Application Phase for resumed sessions) would be similar to the
following:

     int client_avp (gnuls_session_t *session, void *ptr,
                     const char *last, size_t lastlen,
     		char **new, size_t *newlen)
     {
     ...
     }
     ...
     int main ()
     {
       gnutls_ia_client_credentials_t iacred;
     ...
       gnutls_init (&session, GNUTLS_CLIENT);
     ...
       /* Enable TLS/IA. */
       gnutls_ia_allocate_client_credentials(&iacred);
       gnutls_ia_set_client_avp_function(iacred, client_avp);
       gnutls_credentials_set (session, GNUTLS_CRD_IA, iacred);
     ...
       ret = gnutls_handshake (session);
       // Error handling...
     ...
       if (gnutls_ia_handshake_p (session))
         {
           ret = gnutls_ia_handshake (session);
           // Error handling...
     ...

See below for detailed descriptions of all the functions used above.

The function `client_avp' would have to be implemented by your
application.  The function is responsible for handling the AVP data.
See `gnutls_ia_set_client_avp_function' below for more information on
how that function should be implemented.

The control flow in a typical server is similar to the above, use
`gnutls_ia_server_credentials_t' instead of
`gnutls_ia_client_credentials_t', and replace the call to the client
functions with the corresponding server functions.

gnutls_ia_allocate_client_credentials
-------------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_ia_allocate_client_credentials
          (gnutls_ia_client_credentials_t * SC)
     SC: is a pointer to an `gnutls_ia_server_credentials_t' structure.

     This structure is complex enough to manipulate directly thus this
     helper function is provided in order to allocate it.

     Adding this credential to a session will enable TLS/IA, and will
     require an Application Phase after the TLS handshake (if the server
     support TLS/IA).  Use `gnutls_ia_require_inner_phase()' to toggle
     the TLS/IA mode.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise an error code is returned.

gnutls_ia_allocate_server_credentials
-------------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_ia_allocate_server_credentials
          (gnutls_ia_server_credentials_t * SC)
     SC: is a pointer to an `gnutls_ia_server_credentials_t' structure.

     This structure is complex enough to manipulate directly thus this
     helper function is provided in order to allocate it.

     Adding this credential to a session will enable TLS/IA, and will
     require an Application Phase after the TLS handshake (if the client
     support TLS/IA).  Use `gnutls_ia_require_inner_phase()' to toggle
     the TLS/IA mode.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise an error code is returned.

gnutls_ia_enable
----------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_ia_enable (gnutls_session_t SESSION, int
          ALLOW_SKIP_ON_RESUME)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t' structure.

     ALLOW_SKIP_ON_RESUME: non-zero if local party allows to skip the
     TLS/IA application phases for a resumed session.

     Specify whether we must advertise support for the TLS/IA extension
     during the handshake.

     At the client side, we always advertise TLS/IA if gnutls_ia_enable
     was called before the handshake; at the server side, we also
     require that the client has advertised that it wants to run TLS/IA
     before including the advertisement, as required by the protocol.

     Similarly, at the client side we always advertise that we allow
     TLS/IA to be skipped for resumed sessions if `allow_skip_on_resume'
     is non-zero; at the server side, we also require that the session
     is indeed resumable and that the client has also advertised that it
     allows TLS/IA to be skipped for resumed sessions.

     After the TLS handshake, call `gnutls_ia_handshake_p()' to find out
     whether both parties agreed to do a TLS/IA handshake, before
     calling `gnutls_ia_handshake()' or one of the lower level
     gnutls_ia_* functions.

gnutls_ia_endphase_send
-----------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_ia_endphase_send (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          int FINAL_P)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t' structure.

     FINAL_P: Set iff this should signal the final phase.

     Send a TLS/IA end phase message.

     In the client, this should only be used to acknowledge an end phase
     message sent by the server.

     In the server, this can be called instead of `gnutls_ia_send()' if
     the server wishes to end an application phase.

     *Return value:* Return 0 on success, or an error code.

gnutls_ia_extract_inner_secret
------------------------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_ia_extract_inner_secret (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, char * BUFFER)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t' structure.

     BUFFER: pre-allocated buffer to hold 48 bytes of inner secret.

     Copy the 48 bytes large inner secret into the specified buffer

     This function is typically used after the TLS/IA handshake has
     concluded.  The TLS/IA inner secret can be used as input to a PRF
     to derive session keys.  Do not use the inner secret directly as a
     session key, because for a resumed session that does not include an
     application phase, the inner secret will be identical to the inner
     secret in the original session.  It is important to include, for
     example, the client and server randomness when deriving a sesssion
     key from the inner secret.

          (gnutls_ia_server_credentials_t CRED)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_ia_client_credentials_t' structure.

     Returns the pointer that will be provided to the TLS/IA callback
     function as the first argument.

     *Returns:* The server callback data pointer.

gnutls_ia_handshake_p
---------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_ia_handshake_p (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t' structure.

     Predicate to be used after `gnutls_handshake()' to decide whether
     to invoke `gnutls_ia_handshake()'.  Usable by both clients and
     servers.

     *Return value:* non-zero if TLS/IA handshake is expected, zero
     otherwise.

gnutls_ia_handshake
-------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_ia_handshake (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t' structure.

     Perform a TLS/IA handshake.  This should be called after
     `gnutls_handshake()' iff `gnutls_ia_handshake_p()'.

     Return 0 on success, or an error code.

gnutls_ia_permute_inner_secret
------------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_ia_permute_inner_secret (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, size_t SESSION_KEYS_SIZE, const char * SESSION_KEYS)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t' structure.

     SESSION_KEYS_SIZE: Size of generated session keys (0 if none).

     SESSION_KEYS: Generated session keys, used to permute inner secret
     (NULL if none).

     Permute the inner secret using the generated session keys.

     This can be called in the TLS/IA AVP callback to mix any generated
     session keys with the TLS/IA inner secret.

     *Return value:* Return zero on success, or a negative error code.

gnutls_ia_recv
--------------

 -- Function: ssize_t gnutls_ia_recv (gnutls_session_t SESSION, char *
          DATA, size_t SIZEOFDATA)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t' structure.

     DATA: the buffer that the data will be read into, must hold >= 12
     bytes.

     SIZEOFDATA: the number of requested bytes, must be >= 12.

     Receive TLS/IA data.  This function has the similar semantics with
     `recv()'. The only difference is that is accepts a GNUTLS session,
     and uses different error codes.

     If the server attempt to finish an application phase, this function
     will return `GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_IPHF_RECEIVED' or
     `GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_FPHF_RECEIVED'.  The caller should then invoke
     `gnutls_ia_verify_endphase()', and if it runs the client side, also
     send an endphase message of its own using gnutls_ia_endphase_send.

     If EINTR is returned by the internal push function (the default is
     `code'{`recv()'}) then GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED will be returned.  If
     GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED or GNUTLS_E_AGAIN is returned, you must call
     this function again, with the same parameters; alternatively you
     could provide a NULL pointer for data, and 0 for size.

     *Returns:* The number of bytes received.  A negative error code is
     returned in case of an error.  The
     `GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_IPHF_RECEIVED' and
     `GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_FPHF_RECEIVED' errors are returned when an
     application phase finished message has been sent by the server.

gnutls_ia_send
--------------

 -- Function: ssize_t gnutls_ia_send (gnutls_session_t SESSION, const
          char * DATA, size_t SIZEOFDATA)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t' structure.

     DATA: contains the data to send

     SIZEOFDATA: is the length of the data

     Send TLS/IA application payload data.  This function has the
     similar semantics with `send()'. The only difference is that is
     accepts a GNUTLS session, and uses different error codes.

     The TLS/IA protocol is synchronous, so you cannot send more than
     one packet at a time.  The client always send the first packet.

     To finish an application phase in the server, use
     `gnutls_ia_endphase_send()'.  The client cannot end an application
     phase unilaterally; rather, a client is required to respond with an
     endphase of its own if gnutls_ia_recv indicates that the server has
     sent one.

     If the EINTR is returned by the internal push function (the default
     is `send()'} then `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' will be returned.  If
     `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' or `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' is returned, you must
     call this function again, with the same parameters; alternatively
     you could provide a `NULL' pointer for data, and 0 for size.

     *Returns:* The number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.

gnutls_ia_set_client_avp_function
---------------------------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_ia_set_client_avp_function
          (gnutls_ia_client_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_ia_avp_func
          AVP_FUNC)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_ia_client_credentials_t' structure.

     AVP_FUNC: is the callback function

     Set the TLS/IA AVP callback handler used for the session.

     The AVP callback is called to process AVPs received from the
     server, and to get a new AVP to send to the server.

     The callback's function form is: int (*avp_func) (gnutls_session_t
     session, void *ptr, const char *last, size_t lastlen, char **next,
     size_t *nextlen);

     The `session' parameter is the `gnutls_session_t' structure
     corresponding to the current session.  The `ptr' parameter is the
     application hook pointer, set through
     `gnutls_ia_set_client_avp_ptr()'.  The AVP received from the server
     is present in `last' of `lastlen' size, which will be `NULL' on the
     first invocation.  The newly allocated output AVP to send to the
     server should be placed in *`next' of *`nextlen' size.

     The callback may invoke `gnutls_ia_permute_inner_secret()' to mix
     any generated session keys with the TLS/IA inner secret.

     Return 0 (`GNUTLS_IA_APPLICATION_PAYLOAD') on success, or a
     negative error code to abort the TLS/IA handshake.

     Note that the callback must use allocate the `next' parameter using
     `gnutls_malloc()', because it is released via `gnutls_free()' by
     the TLS/IA handshake function.

gnutls_ia_set_client_avp_ptr
----------------------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_ia_set_client_avp_ptr
          (gnutls_ia_client_credentials_t CRED, void * PTR)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_ia_client_credentials_t' structure.

     PTR: is the pointer

     Sets the pointer that will be provided to the TLS/IA callback
     function as the first argument.

gnutls_ia_set_server_avp_function
---------------------------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_ia_set_server_avp_function
          (gnutls_ia_server_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_ia_avp_func
          AVP_FUNC)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_ia_server_credentials_t' structure.

     Set the TLS/IA AVP callback handler used for the session.

     The callback's function form is: int (*avp_func) (gnutls_session_t
     session, void *ptr, const char *last, size_t lastlen, char **next,
     size_t *nextlen);

     The `session' parameter is the `gnutls_session_t' structure
     corresponding to the current session.  The `ptr' parameter is the
     application hook pointer, set through
     `gnutls_ia_set_server_avp_ptr()'.  The AVP received from the client
     is present in `last' of `lastlen' size.  The newly allocated output
     AVP to send to the client should be placed in *`next' of *`nextlen'
     size.

     The AVP callback is called to process incoming AVPs from the
     client, and to get a new AVP to send to the client.  It can also be
     used to instruct the TLS/IA handshake to do go into the
     Intermediate or Final phases.  It return a negative error code, or
     an `gnutls_ia_apptype_t' message type.

     The callback may invoke `gnutls_ia_permute_inner_secret()' to mix
     any generated session keys with the TLS/IA inner secret.

     Specifically, return `GNUTLS_IA_APPLICATION_PAYLOAD' (0) to send
     another AVP to the client, return
     `GNUTLS_IA_INTERMEDIATE_PHASE_FINISHED' (1) to indicate that an
     IntermediatePhaseFinished message should be sent, and return
     `GNUTLS_IA_FINAL_PHASE_FINISHED' (2) to indicate that an
     FinalPhaseFinished message should be sent.  In the last two cases,
     the contents of the `next' and `nextlen' parameter is not used.

     Note that the callback must use allocate the `next' parameter using
     `gnutls_malloc()', because it is released via `gnutls_free()' by
     the TLS/IA handshake function.

gnutls_ia_set_server_avp_ptr
----------------------------

 -- Function: void gnutls_ia_set_server_avp_ptr
          (gnutls_ia_server_credentials_t CRED, void * PTR)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_ia_client_credentials_t' structure.

     PTR: is the pointer

     Sets the pointer that will be provided to the TLS/IA callback
     function as the first argument.

gnutls_ia_verify_endphase
-------------------------

 -- Function: int gnutls_ia_verify_endphase (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          const char * CHECKSUM)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t' structure.

     CHECKSUM: 12-byte checksum data, received from `gnutls_ia_recv()'.

     Verify TLS/IA end phase checksum data.  If verification fails, the
     `GNUTLS_A_INNER_APPLICATION_VERIFICATION' alert is sent to the
     other sie.

     This function is called when `gnutls_ia_recv()' return
     `GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_IPHF_RECEIVED' or
     `GNUTLS_E_WARNING_IA_FPHF_RECEIVED'.

     *Return value:* Return 0 on successful verification, or an error
     code.  If the checksum verification of the end phase message fails,
     `GNUTLS_E_IA_VERIFY_FAILED' is returned.

Some additional information regarding some of the algorithms:

`RSA'
     RSA is public key cryptosystem designed by Ronald Rivest, Adi
     Shamir and Leonard Adleman.  It can be used with any hash
     functions.

`DSA'
     DSA is the USA's Digital Signature Standard.  It uses only the
     SHA-1 hash algorithm.

`MD2'
     MD2 is a cryptographic hash algorithm designed by Ron Rivest.  It
     is optimized for 8-bit processors. Outputs 128 bits of data.
     There are no known weaknesses of this algorithm but since this
     algorithm is rarely used and not really studied it should not be
     used today.

`MD5'
     MD5 is a cryptographic hash algorithm designed by Ron Rivest.
     Outputs 128 bits of data.  It is considered to be broken.

`SHA-1'
     SHA is a cryptographic hash algorithm designed by NSA. Outputs 160
     bits of data.  It is also considered to be broken, though no
     practical attacks have been found.

`RMD160'
     RIPEMD is a cryptographic hash algorithm developed in the
     framework of the EU project RIPE.  Outputs 160 bits of data.

*****************

This chapter describes the GNU Guile
(http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/) Scheme programming interface to
GnuTLS.  The reader is assumed to have basic knowledge of the protocol
and library.  Details missing from this chapter may be found in *note

At this stage, not all the C functions are available from Scheme, but a
large subset thereof is available.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Guile Preparations,  Next: Guile API Conventions,  Up: Guile Bindings

11.1 Guile Preparations
=======================

The GnuTLS Guile bindings are by default installed under the GnuTLS
installation directory (e.g., typically
`/usr/local/share/guile/site/').  Normally Guile will not find the
module there without help.  You may experience something like this:

     $ guile
     guile> (use-modules (gnutls))
     <unnamed port>: no code for module (gnutls)
     guile>

There are two ways to solve this.  The first is to make sure that when
building GnuTLS, the Guile bindings will be installed in the same place
where Guile looks.  You may do this by using the
`--with-guile-site-dir' parameter as follows:

     $ ./configure --with-guile-site-dir=no

This will instruct GnuTLS to attempt to install the Guile bindings
where Guile will look for them.  It will use `guile-config info
pkgdatadir' to learn the path to use.

If Guile was installed into `/usr', you may also install GnuTLS using
the same prefix:

     $ ./configure --prefix=/usr

If you want to specify the path to install the Guile bindings you can
also specify the path directly:

     $ ./configure --with-guile-site-dir=/opt/guile/share/guile/site

The second solution requires some more work but may be easier to use if
you do not have system administrator rights to your machine.  You need
to instruct Guile so that it finds the GnuTLS Guile bindings.  Either
use the `GUILE_LOAD_PATH' environment variable as follows:

     $ GUILE_LOAD_PATH="/usr/local/share/guile/site:$GUILE_LOAD_PATH" guile
     guile> (use-modules (gnutls))
     guile>

Alternatively, you can modify Guile's `%load-path' variable (*note
Guile's run-time options: (guile)Build Config.).

At this point, you might get an error regarding `libguile-gnutls-v-0'
similar to:

     gnutls.scm:361:1: In procedure dynamic-link in expression (load-extension "libguile-gnutls-v-0" "scm_init_gnutls"):
     gnutls.scm:361:1: file: "libguile-gnutls-v-0", message: "libguile-gnutls-v-0.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

In this case, you will need to modify the run-time linker path, for
example as follows:

     $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib GUILE_LOAD_PATH=/usr/local/share/guile/site guile
     guile> (use-modules (gnutls))
     guile>

11.2 Guile API Conventions
==========================

This chapter details the conventions used by Guile API, as well as
specificities of the mapping of the C API to Scheme.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Enumerates and Constants,  Next: Procedure Names,  Up: Guile API Conventions

11.2.1 Enumerates and Constants
-------------------------------

Lots of enumerates and constants are used in the GnuTLS C API.  For
each C enumerate type, a disjoint Scheme type is used--thus, enumerate
values and constants are not represented by Scheme symbols nor by
integers.  This makes it impossible to use an enumerate value of the
wrong type on the Scheme side: such errors are automatically detected
by type-checking.

The enumerate values are bound to variables exported by the `(gnutls)'
and `(gnutls extra)' modules.  These variables are named according to
the following convention:

   * All variable names are lower-case; the underscore `_' character
     used in the C API is replaced by hyphen `-'.

   * All variable names are prepended by the name of the enumerate type
     and the slash `/' character.

   * In some cases, the variable name is made more explicit than the
     one of the C API, e.g., by avoid abbreviations.

Consider for instance this C-side enumerate:

     typedef enum
     {
       GNUTLS_CRD_CERTIFICATE = 1,
       GNUTLS_CRD_ANON,
       GNUTLS_CRD_SRP,
       GNUTLS_CRD_PSK,
       GNUTLS_CRD_IA
     } gnutls_credentials_type_t;

The corresponding Scheme values are bound to the following variables
exported by the `(gnutls)' module:

     credentials/certificate
     credentials/anonymous
     credentials/srp
     credentials/psk
     credentials/ia

Hopefully, most variable names can be deduced from this convention.

Scheme-side "enumerate" values can be compared using `eq?' (*note
equality predicates: (guile)Equality.).  Consider the following example:

     (let ((session (make-session connection-end/client)))

       ;;
       ;; ...
       ;;

       ;; Check the ciphering algorithm currently used by SESSION.
       (if (eq? cipher/arcfour (session-cipher session))
           (format #t "We're using the ARCFOUR algorithm")))

In addition, all enumerate values can be converted to a human-readable
string, in a type-specific way.  For instance, `(cipher->string
cipher/arcfour)' yields `"ARCFOUR 128"', while `(key-usage->string
key-usage/digital-signature)' yields `"digital-signature"'.  Note that
these strings may not be sufficient for use in a user interface since
they are fairly concise and not internationalized.

11.2.2 Procedure Names
----------------------

Unlike C functions in GnuTLS, the corresponding Scheme procedures are
named in a way that is close to natural English.  Abbreviations are
also avoided.  For instance, the Scheme procedure corresponding to
`gnutls_certificate_set_dh_params' is named
`set-certificate-credentials-dh-parameters!'.  The `gnutls_' prefix is
always omitted from variable names since a similar effect can be
achieved using Guile's nifty binding renaming facilities, should it be
needed (*note Using Guile Modules: (guile)Using Guile Modules.).

Often Scheme procedure names differ from C function names in a way that
makes it clearer what objects they operate on.  For example, the Scheme
procedure named `set-session-transport-port!' corresponds to
`gnutls_transport_set_ptr', making it clear that this procedure applies
to session.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Representation of Binary Data,  Next: Input and Output,  Prev: Procedure Names,  Up: Guile API Conventions

11.2.3 Representation of Binary Data
------------------------------------

Many procedures operate on binary data.  For instance,
`pkcs3-import-dh-parameters' expects binary data as input and,
similarly, procedures like `pkcs1-export-rsa-parameters' return binary
data.

Binary data is represented on the Scheme side using SRFI-4 homogeneous
vectors (*note SRFI-4: (guile)SRFI-4.).  Although any type of
homogeneous vector may be used, `u8vector's (i.e., vectors of bytes)
are highly recommended.

As an example, generating and then exporting RSA parameters in the PEM
format can be done as follows:

     (let* ((rsa-params (make-rsa-parameters 1024))
            (raw-data
             (pkcs1-export-rsa-parameters rsa-params
                                          x509-certificate-format/pem)))
       (uniform-vector-write raw-data (open-output-file "some-file.pem")))

OpenPGP Keys Guile Example::.

11.2.4 Input and Output
-----------------------

The underlying transport of a TLS session can be any Scheme
input/output port (*note Ports and File Descriptors: (guile)Ports and
File Descriptors.).  This has to be specified using
`set-session-transport-port!'.

However, for better performance, a raw file descriptor can be
specified, using `set-session-transport-fd!'.  For instance, if the
transport layer is a socket port over an OS-provided socket, you can
use the `port->fdes' or `fileno' procedure to obtain the underlying
file descriptor and pass it to `set-session-transport-fd!'  (*note
`port->fdes' and `fileno': (guile)Ports and File Descriptors.).  This
would work as follows:

     (let ((socket (socket PF_INET SOCK_STREAM 0))
           (session (make-session connection-end/client)))

       ;;
       ;; Establish a TCP connection...
       ;;

       ;; Use the file descriptor that underlies SOCKET.
       (set-session-transport-fd! session (fileno socket)))

Once a TLS session is established, data can be communicated through it
(i.e., _via_ the TLS record layer) using the port returned by
`session-record-port':

     (let ((session (make-session connection-end/client)))

       ;;
       ;; Initialize the various parameters of SESSION, set up
       ;; a network connection, etc...
       ;;

       (let ((i/o (session-record-port session)))
         (write "Hello peer!" i/o)
         (let ((greetings (read i/o)))

           ;; ...

           (bye session close-request/rdwr))))

A lower-level I/O API is provided by `record-send' and
`record-receive!' which take an SRFI-4 vector to represent the data
sent or received.  While it might improve performance, it is much less
convenient than the above and should rarely be needed.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Exception Handling,  Prev: Input and Output,  Up: Guile API Conventions

11.2.5 Exception Handling
-------------------------

GnuTLS errors are implemented as Scheme exceptions (*note exceptions in
Guile: (guile)Exceptions.).  Each time a GnuTLS function returns an
error, an exception with key `gnutls-error' is raised.  The additional
arguments that are thrown include an error code and the name of the
GnuTLS procedure that raised the exception.  The error code is pretty
much like an enumerate value: it is one of the `error/' variables
exported by the `(gnutls)' module (*note Enumerates and Constants::).
Exceptions can be turned into error messages using the `error->string'
procedure.

The following examples illustrates how GnuTLS exceptions can be handled:

     (let ((session (make-session connection-end/server)))

       ;;
       ;; ...
       ;;

       (catch 'gnutls-error
         (lambda ()
           (handshake session))
         (lambda (key err function . currently-unused)
           (format (current-error-port)
                   "a GnuTLS error was raised by `~a': ~a~%"
                   function (error->string err)))))

Again, error values can be compared using `eq?':

         ;; `gnutls-error' handler.
         (lambda (key err function . currently-unused)
           (if (eq? err error/fatal-alert-received)
               (format (current-error-port)
                       "a fatal alert was caught!~%")
               (format (current-error-port)
                       "something bad happened: ~a~%"
                       (error->string err))))

Note that the `catch' handler is currently passed only 3 arguments but
future versions might provide it with additional arguments.  Thus, it
must be prepared to handle more than 3 arguments, as in this example.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Anonymous Authentication Guile Example,  Next: OpenPGP Authentication Guile Example,  Up: Guile Examples

11.3.1 Anonymous Authentication Guile Example
---------------------------------------------

"Anonymous authentication" is very easy to use.  No certificates are
needed by the communicating parties.  Yet, it allows them to benefit
from end-to-end encryption and integrity checks.

The client-side code would look like this (assuming SOME-SOCKET is
bound to an open socket port):

     ;; Client-side.

     (let ((client (make-session connection-end/client)))
       ;; Use the default settings.
       (set-session-default-priority! client)

       ;; Don't use certificate-based authentication.
       (set-session-certificate-type-priority! client '())

       ;; Request the "anonymous Diffie-Hellman" key exchange method.
       (set-session-kx-priority! client (list kx/anon-dh))

       ;; Specify the underlying socket.
       (set-session-transport-fd! client (fileno some-socket))

       ;; Create anonymous credentials.
       (set-session-credentials! client
                                 (make-anonymous-client-credentials))

       ;; Perform the TLS handshake with the server.
       (handshake client)

       ;; Send data over the TLS record layer.
       (write "hello, world!" (session-record-port client))

       ;; Terminate the TLS session.
       (bye client close-request/rdwr))

The corresponding server would look like this (again, assuming
SOME-SOCKET is bound to a socket port):

     ;; Server-side.

     (let ((server (make-session connection-end/server)))
       (set-session-default-priority! server)
       (set-session-certificate-type-priority! server '())
       (set-session-kx-priority! server (list kx/anon-dh))

       ;; Specify the underlying transport socket.
       (set-session-transport-fd! server (fileno some-socket))

       ;; Create anonymous credentials.
       (let ((cred (make-anonymous-server-credentials))
             (dh-params (make-dh-parameters 1024)))
         ;; Note: DH parameter generation can take some time.
         (set-anonymous-server-dh-parameters! cred dh-params)
         (set-session-credentials! server cred))

       ;; Perform the TLS handshake with the client.
       (handshake server)

       ;; Receive data over the TLS record layer.
       (let ((message (read (session-record-port server))))
         (format #t "received the following message: ~a~%"
                 message)

         (bye server close-request/rdwr)))

This is it!

11.3.2 OpenPGP Authentication Guile Example
-------------------------------------------

GnuTLS allows users to authenticate using OpenPGP certificates.  The
relevant procedures are provided by the `(gnutls extra)' module.  Using
OpenPGP-based authentication is not more complicated than using
anonymous authentication.  It requires a bit of extra work, though, to
import the OpenPGP public and private key of the client/server.  Key
import is omitted here and is left as an exercise to the reader (*note
Importing OpenPGP Keys Guile Example::).

Assuming SOME-SOCKET is bound to an open socket port and PUB and SEC
are bound to the client's OpenPGP public and secret key, respectively,
client-side code would look like this:

     ;; Client-side.

     (define %certs (list certificate-type/openpgp))

     (let ((client (make-session connection-end/client))
           (cred   (make-certificate-credentials)))
       (set-session-default-priority! client)

       ;; Choose OpenPGP certificates.
       (set-session-certificate-type-priority! client %certs)

       ;; Prepare appropriate client credentials.
       (set-certificate-credentials-openpgp-keys! cred pub sec)
       (set-session-credentials! client cred)

       ;; Specify the underlying transport socket.
       (set-session-transport-fd! client (fileno some-socket))

       (handshake client)
       (write "hello, world!" (session-record-port client))
       (bye client close-request/rdwr))

Similarly, server-side code would be along these lines:

     ;; Server-side.

     (define %certs (list certificate-type/openpgp))

     (let ((server (make-session connection-end/server))
           (rsa    (make-rsa-parameters 1024))
           (dh     (make-dh-parameters 1024)))
       (set-session-default-priority! server)

       ;; Choose OpenPGP certificates.
       (set-session-certificate-type-priority! server %certs)

       (let ((cred (make-certificate-credentials)))
         ;; Prepare credentials with RSA and Diffie-Hellman parameters.
         (set-certificate-credentials-dh-parameters! cred dh)
         (set-certificate-credentials-rsa-export-parameters! cred rsa)
         (set-certificate-credentials-openpgp-keys! cred pub sec)
         (set-session-credentials! server cred))

       (set-session-transport-fd! server (fileno some-socket))

       (handshake server)
       (let ((msg (read (session-record-port server))))
         (format #t "received: ~a~%" msg)

         (bye server close-request/rdwr)))

In practice, generating RSA parameters (and Diffie-Hellman parameters)
can time a long time.  Thus, you may want to generate them once and
store them in a file for future re-use (*note
`pkcs1-export-rsa-parameters' and `pkcs1-import-rsa-parameters': Core
Interface.).

11.3.3 Importing OpenPGP Keys Guile Example
-------------------------------------------

The following example provides a simple way of importing
"ASCII-armored" OpenPGP keys from files, using the
`import-openpgp-certificate' and `import-openpgp-private-key'
procedures provided by the `(gnutls extra)' module.

     (use-modules (srfi srfi-4)
                  (gnutls extra))

     (define (import-key-from-file import-proc file)
       ;; Import OpenPGP key from FILE using IMPORT-PROC.

       ;; Prepare a u8vector large enough to hold the raw
       ;; key contents.
       (let* ((size (stat:size (stat path)))
              (raw  (make-u8vector size)))

         ;; Fill in the u8vector with the contents of FILE.
         (uniform-vector-read! raw (open-input-file file))

         ;; Pass the u8vector to the import procedure.
         (import-proc raw openpgp-certificate-format/base64)))


     (define (import-public-key-from-file file)
       (import-key-from-file import-openpgp-certificate file))

     (define (import-private-key-from-file file)
       (import-key-from-file import-openpgp-private-key file))

The procedures `import-public-key-from-file' and
`import-private-key-from-file' can be passed a file name.  They return
an OpenPGP public key and private key object, respectively (*note
OpenPGP key objects: Extra Interface.).

12 Internal Architecture of GnuTLS
**********************************

This chapter is to give a brief description of the way GnuTLS works.
The focus is to give an idea to potential developers and those who want
to know what happens inside the black box.

* Menu:

* The TLS Protocol::
* TLS Handshake Protocol::
* TLS Authentication Methods::
* TLS Extension Handling::
* Cryptographic Backend::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: The TLS Protocol,  Next: TLS Handshake Protocol,  Up: Internal architecture of GnuTLS

12.1 The TLS Protocol
=====================

The main needs for the TLS protocol to be used are shown in the image
below.

 [image src="gnutls-client-server-use-case.png" ]

This is being accomplished by the following object diagram.  Note that
since GnuTLS is being developed in C object are just structures with
attributes. The operations listed are functions that require the first
parameter to be that object.   [image src="gnutls-objects.png" ]


File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS Handshake Protocol,  Next: TLS Authentication Methods,  Prev: The TLS Protocol,  Up: Internal architecture of GnuTLS

12.2 TLS Handshake Protocol
===========================

The GnuTLS handshake protocol is implemented as a state machine that
waits for input or returns immediately when the non-blocking transport
layer functions are used. The main idea is shown in the following
figure.

 [image src="gnutls-handshake-state.png" ]

Also the way the input is processed varies per ciphersuite. Several
implementations of the internal handlers are available and *note
gnutls_handshake:: only multiplexes the input to the appropriate
handler. For example a PSK ciphersuite has a different implementation
of the `process_client_key_exchange' than a certificate ciphersuite.

 [image src="gnutls-handshake-sequence.png" ]


File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS Authentication Methods,  Next: TLS Extension Handling,  Prev: TLS Handshake Protocol,  Up: Internal architecture of GnuTLS

12.3 TLS Authentication Methods
===============================

In GnuTLS authentication methods can be implemented quite easily.
Since the required changes to add a new authentication method affect
only the handshake protocol, a simple interface is used. An
authentication method needs only to implement the functions as seen in
the figure below.

 [image src="gnutls-mod_auth_st.png" ]

The functions that need to be implemented are the ones responsible for
interpreting the handshake protocol messages. It is common for such
functions to read data from one or more `credentials_t' structures(1)
and write data, such as certificates, usernames etc. to `auth_info_t'
structures.

Simple examples of existing authentication methods can be seen in
`auth_psk.c' for PSK ciphersuites and `auth_srp.c' for SRP
ciphersuites. After implementing these functions the structure holding
its pointers has to be registered in `gnutls_algorithms.c' in the
`_gnutls_kx_algorithms' structure.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS Extension Handling,  Next: Cryptographic Backend,  Prev: TLS Authentication Methods,  Up: Internal architecture of GnuTLS

12.4 TLS Extension Handling
===========================

As with authentication methods, the TLS extensions handlers can be
implemented using the following interface.

 [image src="gnutls-extensions_st.png" ]

Here there are two functions, one for receiving the extension data and
one for sending. These functions have to check internally whether they
operate in client or server side.

A simple example of an extension handler can be seen in `ext_srp.c'
After implementing these functions, together with the extension number
they handle, they have to be registered in `gnutls_extensions.c' in the
`_gnutls_extensions' structure.

12.4.1 Adding a New TLS Extension
---------------------------------

Adding support for a new TLS extension is done from time to time, and
the process to do so is not difficult.  Here are the steps you need to
follow if you wish to do this yourself.  For sake of discussion, let's
consider adding support for the hypothetical TLS extension `foobar'.

  1. Modify `configure.in' to add `--enable-foobar' or
     `--disable-foobar'.

     Which to chose depends on whether you intend to make the extension
     be enabled by default.  Look at existing checks (i.e., SRP, authz)
     for how to model the code.  For example:

          AC_MSG_CHECKING([whether to disable foobar support])
          AC_ARG_ENABLE(foobar,
          	AS_HELP_STRING([--disable-foobar],
          		[disable foobar support]),
          	ac_enable_foobar=no)
          if test x$ac_enable_foobar != xno; then
           AC_MSG_RESULT(no)
           AC_DEFINE(ENABLE_FOOBAR, 1, [enable foobar])
          else
           ac_full=0
           AC_MSG_RESULT(yes)
          fi
          AM_CONDITIONAL(ENABLE_FOOBAR, test "$ac_enable_foobar" != "no")

  2. Add IANA extension value to `extensions_t' in `gnutls_int.h'.

     A good name for the value would be GNUTLS_EXTENSION_FOOBAR.  Check
     with `http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-extensiontype-values'
     for allocated values.  For experiments, you could pick a number but
     remember that some consider it a bad idea to deploy such modified
     version since it will lead to interoperability problems in the
     future when the IANA allocates that number to someone else, or
     when the foobar protocol is allocated another number.

  3. Add an entry to `_gnutls_extensions' in `gnutls_extensions.c'.

     A typical entry would be:

          #if ENABLE_FOOBAR
            GNUTLS_EXTENSION_ENTRY (GNUTLS_EXTENSION_FOOBAR,
          			  _gnutls_foobar_recv_params,
          			  _gnutls_foobar_send_params),
          #endif

     The GNUTLS_EXTENSION_FOOBAR is the integer value you added to
     `gnutls_int.h' earlier.  The two functions are new functions that
     you will need to implement, most likely you'll need to add an
     `#include "ext_foobar.h"' as well.

  4. Add new files `ext_foobar.c' and `ext_foobar.h' that implements
     the extension.

     The functions you are responsible to add are those mentioned in the
     previous step.  As a starter, you could add this:

          int
          _gnutls_foobar_recv_params (gnutls_session_t session,
                                      const opaque * data,
                                      size_t data_size)
          {
            return 0;
          }

          int
          _gnutls_foobar_send_params (gnutls_session_t session,
                                      opaque * data,
                                      size_t _data_size)
          {
            return 0;
          }

     The `_gnutls_foobar_recv_params' function is responsible for
     parsing incoming extension data (both in the client and server).

     The `_gnutls_foobar_send_params' function is responsible for
     sending extension data (both in the client and server).

     If you receive length fields that doesn't match, return
     `GNUTLS_E_UNEXPECTED_PACKET_LENGTH'.  If you receive invalid data,
     return `GNUTLS_E_RECEIVED_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER'.  You can use other
     error codes too.  Return 0 on success.

     The function typically store some information in the `session'
     variable for later usage.  If you need to add new fields there,
     check `tls_ext_st' in `gnutls_int.h' and compare with existing TLS
     extension specific variables.

     Recall that both the client and server both send and receives
     parameters, and your code most likely will need to do different
     things depending on which mode it is in.  It may be useful to make
     this distinction explicit in the code.  Thus, for example, a better
     template than above would be:

          int
          _gnutls_foobar_recv_params (gnutls_session_t session,
                                      const opaque * data,
                                      size_t data_size)
          {
            if (session->security_parameters.entity == GNUTLS_CLIENT)
              return foobar_recv_client (session, data, data_size);
            else
              return foobar_recv_server (session, data, data_size);
          }

          int
          _gnutls_foobar_send_params (gnutls_session_t session,
                                      opaque * data,
                                      size_t data_size)
          {
            if (session->security_parameters.entity == GNUTLS_CLIENT)
              return foobar_send_client (session, data, data_size);
            else
              return foobar_send_server (session, data, data_size);
          }

     The functions used would be declared as `static' functions, of the
     appropriate prototype, in the same file.

     When adding the files, you'll need to add them to `Makefile.am' as
     well, for example:

          if ENABLE_FOOBAR
          COBJECTS += ext_foobar.c
          HFILES += ext_foobar.h
          endif

  5. Add API functions to enable/disable the extension.

     Normally the client will have one API to request use of the
     extension, and setting some extension specific data.  The server
     will have one API to let the library know that it is willing to
     accept the extension, often this is implemented through a callback
     but it doesn't have to.

     The APIs need to be added to `includes/gnutls/gnutls.h' or
     `includes/gnutls/extra.h' as appropriate.  It is recommended that
     if you don't have a requirement to use the LGPLv2.1+ license for
     your extension, that you place your work under the GPLv3+ license
     and thus in the libgnutls-extra library.

     You can implement the API function in the `ext_foobar.c' file, or
     if that file ends up becoming rather larger, add a
     `gnutls_foobar.c' file.


12.5 Certificate Handling
=========================

What is provided by the certificate handling functions is summarized in
the following diagram.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Cryptographic Backend,  Prev: TLS Extension Handling,  Up: Internal architecture of GnuTLS

12.6 Cryptographic Backend
==========================

Several new systems provide hardware assisted cryptographic algorithm
implementations that offer implementations some orders of magnitude
faster than the software. For this reason in current releases of GnuTLS
it is possible to override parts of the crypto backend or the whole. It
is possible to override them both at runtime and compile time, however
here we will discuss the runtime possibility. The API available for
this functionality is in `gnutls/crypto.h' header file.

12.6.1 Override specific algorithms
-----------------------------------

When an optimized implementation of a single algorithm is available,
say a hardware assisted version of AES-CBC then the following functions
can be used to register those algorithms.

   * *note gnutls_crypto_single_cipher_register2:: To register a cipher
     algorithm.

   * *note gnutls_crypto_single_mac_register2:: To register a MAC
     algorithm.

     *note gnutls_crypto_single_digest_register2:: To register a digest
     (hash) algorithm.


Those registration functions will only replace the specified algorithm
and leave the rest of subsystem intact.

12.6.2 Override parts of the backend
------------------------------------

In some systems, such as embedded ones, it might be desirable to
override big parts of the cryptographic backend, or even all of them.
For this reason the following functions are provided.

   * *note gnutls_crypto_cipher_register2:: To override the
     cryptographic algorithms backend.

   * *note gnutls_crypto_mac_register2:: To override the MAC algorithms
     backend.

   * *note gnutls_crypto_digest_register2:: To override the digest
     algorithms backend.

   * *note gnutls_crypto_rnd_register2:: To override the random number
     generator backend.

   * *note gnutls_crypto_bigint_register2:: To override the big number
     number operations backend.

   * *note gnutls_crypto_pk_register2:: To override the public key
     encryption backend. This is tight to the big number operations so
     either both of them should be updated or care must be taken to use
     the same format.


If all of them are used then GnuTLS will no longer use libgcrypt.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
